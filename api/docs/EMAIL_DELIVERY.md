# Email Deliverability Guide

This document provides recommendations for improving email deliverability for the DiaX API system.

## Current Issues

The system shows different deliverability rates between test emails and password reset emails. The server logs indicate the emails are being sent, but password reset emails may not be delivered to the inbox.

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Domain Configuration

To improve email deliverability, configure your domain with proper authentication:

- **SPF Record**: Add an SPF record to your DNS to authenticate your email server:
  ```
  v=spf1 a mx ip4:YOUR_SERVER_IP ~all
  ```

- **DKIM Authentication**: Set up DKIM to cryptographically sign your emails:
  - Generate DKIM keys
  - Add the public key to your DNS records
  - Configure your mail server to sign outgoing emails

- **DMARC Policy**: Add a DMARC record to instruct email providers on how to handle emails:
  ```
  v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@your-domain.com
  ```

### 2. Sender Email Configuration

- Use a domain-matching email address (e.g., support@diax.cc instead of noreply@diax.cc)
- Consider using a subdomain specifically for transactional emails (e.g., mail.diax.cc)
- Ensure reverse DNS lookup (PTR record) matches your sending domain

### 3. Email Content Improvements

The following improvements have been made to the password reset emails:

- Removed trigger words like "reset" and "password" from subject and content
- Added a spam folder check notification
- Improved email headers with proper Message-ID and priorities
- Reformatted the template to be more deliverability-friendly

### 4. Testing and Monitoring

- Use the included `/test_email.php` script to test different email configurations
- Monitor your server's mail logs for delivery issues
- Use services like mail-tester.com to check your spam score
- Ask recipients to whitelist your domain or mark your emails as "not spam"

### 5. Alternative Solutions

If email deliverability continues to be an issue:

- Consider using a dedicated transactional email service like SendGrid or Mailgun
- Set up specific SMTP credentials for your sending server
- Implement gradual sending (limited number of emails per hour)
- Add detailed sending instructions in your welcome emails

## Implementation Details

The system has been updated to:

1. Improve email headers with proper Message-ID and priorities
2. Modify password reset email templates to avoid spam trigger words
3. Add a spam folder check notification at the top of emails
4. Fall back to PHP mail() function when other providers fail
5. Add logging for email delivery attempts

These changes should significantly improve email deliverability for password reset emails.
